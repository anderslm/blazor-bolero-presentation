# What is Bolero

---
Bolero is a framework that uses the Blazor compiler.

---
Bolero uses the architecture known as `Model-View-Update` (MVU) or `React Architechture` or `Elm Architechture`.

![MVU](https://qiita-user-contents.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fprogramming-elm.com%2Fimg%2Felm-architecture.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.0&auto=format&gif-q=60&q=75&s=1c6e74c4c3db9d3a1c4f2e7b56bccd62)

It's important to note that MVU is effect free or 'pure'. That means that there is no side effects. A side effect is an effect in the real world (or to shared memory).

In order to affect the world the `update` function returns both a new model and also a command to do something. It could be reading from a http api, a database, a file or something similar. 

## Model
The state of the program. That means all data that is required to render the web application in some state.
## View
The `HTML` and `CSS` that is rendered in the browser. 
## Messages
Things that happen. If you press a button, enter some text or otherwise interacts with the program.
## Update
Updates the model when a message is fired.
